# Kottpd Repository Review Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Repository:** gimlet2/kottpd  
**Version Reviewed:** 0.2.2

---

## Executive Summary

Kottpd is a lightweight, pure Kotlin HTTP server framework with significant potential. The codebase is clean and minimal (~316 LOC), making it an excellent choice for simple REST APIs and microservices. However, as an early-stage project (v0.2.x), it requires improvements in documentation, testing, and feature completeness before production readiness.

**Overall Grade:** B-

**Recommendation:** Continue development with focus on testing, documentation, and security improvements as outlined in the development roadmap.

## Technical Debt

### Identified Issues

1. **HttpResponse Header Support**
   - Current implementation doesn't properly support setting custom headers
   - Filters can't effectively set headers before response is sent
   - Needs refactoring for better header management

2. **Thread Pool Configuration**
   - Uses CachedThreadPool without limits
   - Could be improved with configurable pool settings
   - No timeout handling for requests

3. **Error Handling**
   - Exception handling is basic
   - Could benefit from structured error responses
   - No distinction between client and server errors

4. **Static Files**
   - Basic implementation
   - No caching headers
   - No compression support
   - Could be more efficient

---

## Performance Considerations

**Not Currently Benchmarked** - Recommendations:
- Benchmark against similar frameworks (Ktor, Javalin)
- Test under load (JMeter, Gatling)
- Profile memory usage
- Optimize hot paths
- Consider async/coroutines for better scalability

---

## Security Assessment

### Current State
- ⚠️ **Not Production Ready** for high-security applications
- Basic HTTP/HTTPS support is functional
- No built-in security features beyond SSL/TLS

### Recommendations
1. Add security headers by default
2. Implement CSRF protection
3. Add rate limiting
4. Input validation framework
5. Security audit before v1.0.0
6. Penetration testing recommended
