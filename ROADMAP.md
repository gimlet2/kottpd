# Kottpd Development Roadmap

## Vision
Kottpd aims to be a lightweight, pure Kotlin HTTP server framework that is easy to use, performant, and suitable for building microservices and REST APIs.

## Current State (v0.2.2)

### Strengths
- **Minimal footprint**: ~316 lines of core code
- **Pure Kotlin**: No external framework dependencies
- **Simple API**: Easy to understand and use
- **HTTP/HTTPS support**: Built-in SSL/TLS support
- **Routing**: Path-based and regex-based routing
- **Filters**: Before/after request filters
- **Exception handling**: Custom exception handlers
- **Static files**: Built-in static file serving

### Areas for Improvement
- **Testing**: Minimal test coverage
- **Documentation**: Limited examples and API documentation
- **Performance**: Not benchmarked or optimized
- **Features**: Missing common REST framework features
- **Tooling**: Outdated dependencies and build tools
